<p>A <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
 once bought an Ethiopian slave, who had a <span class="picturedef black">black</span>
 <span class="picturedef skin">skin</span>
 <span class="picturedef like">like</span>

all Ethiopians; but his new master thought his colour was due to
his late owner's having neglected him, and that all he wanted was a
good scrubbing. So he set to work with plenty of <span class="picturedef soap">soap</span>
 and <span class="picturedef hot">hot</span>

<span class="picturedef water">water</span>
, and rubbed away at him with a will, but all to no purpose:
his <span class="picturedef skin">skin</span>
 remained as <span class="picturedef black">black</span>
 as ever, while the poor wretch all but
died from the <span class="picturedef cold">cold</span>
 he caught.</p>
