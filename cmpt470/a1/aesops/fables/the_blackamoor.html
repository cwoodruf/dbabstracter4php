<h2>THE BLACKAMOOR</h2>
<br>
<p>A Man once bought an Ethiopian slave, who had a black skin like
all Ethiopians; but his new master thought his colour was due to
his late owner's having neglected him, and that all he wanted was a
good scrubbing. So he set to work with plenty of soap and hot
water, and rubbed away at him with a will, but all to no purpose:
his skin remained as black as ever, while the poor wretch all but
died from the cold he caught.</p>
