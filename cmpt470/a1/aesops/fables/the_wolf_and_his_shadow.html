<p>A Wolf, who was roaming about on the plain when the sun was
getting low in the sky, was much impressed by the size of his
shadow, and said to himself, "I had no idea I was so big. Fancy my
being afraid of a lion! Why, I, not he, ought to be King of the
beasts"; and, heedless of danger, he strutted about as if there
could be no doubt at all about it. Just then a lion sprang upon him
and began to devour him. "Alas," he cried, "had I not lost sight of
the facts, I shouldn't have been ruined by my fancies."</p>
