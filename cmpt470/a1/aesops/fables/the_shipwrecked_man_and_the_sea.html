 <span class="picturedef cast">cast</span>
 <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 on the <span class="picturedef beach">beach</span>
 fell asleep after his
struggle with the waves. When he woke <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
, he bitterly reproached
the <span class="picturedef sea">sea</span>
 for its treachery in enticing men with its <span class="picturedef smooth">smooth</span>
 and
smiling surface, and then, when they were <span class="picturedef well">well</span>
 embarked, turning in
fury upon them and sending both <span class="picturedef ship">ship</span>
 and sailors to destruction.
The <span class="picturedef sea">sea</span>
 arose in the form of a <span class="picturedef woman">woman</span>
, and replied, "Lay not the
blame on me, O sailor, but on the Winds. By nature I am as calm and
<span class="picturedef safe">safe</span>
 as the land itself: but the Winds fall upon me with their
gusts and gales, and lash me into a fury that is not natural to
me."</p>
