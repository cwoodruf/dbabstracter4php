<h2>THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE ANTS</h2>
<br>
<p>One fine day in <span class="picturedef winter">winter</span>
 some Ants were busy <span class="picturedef dry">drying</span>
 their store of
<span class="picturedef corn">corn</span>
, which had got rather damp during a long spell of <span class="picturedef rain">rain</span>
.
Presently <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 came a <span class="picturedef grasshopper">grasshopper</span>
 and begged them to spare her a few
grains, "For," she said, "I'm simply starving." The Ants stopped
work for a moment, though this was against their principles. "May
we ask," said they, "what you were doing with yourself all last
<span class="picturedef summer">summer</span>
? Why didn't you collect a store of food for the <span class="picturedef winter">winter</span>
?"
"The fact is," replied the <span class="picturedef grasshopper">grasshopper</span>
, "I was so busy singing that
I hadn't the time." "If you spent the <span class="picturedef summer">summer</span>
 singing," replied the
Ants, "you can't do better than spend the <span class="picturedef winter">winter</span>
 dancing." And they
chuckled and went on with their work.</p>
