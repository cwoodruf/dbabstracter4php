<h2>THE KINGDOM OF THE LION</h2>
<br>
<p>When the Lion reigned over the beasts of the earth he was never
cruel or tyrannical, but as gentle and just as a King ought to be.
During his reign he called a general assembly of the beasts, and
drew up a code of laws under which all were to live in perfect
equality and harmony: the wolf and the lamb, the tiger and the
stag, the leopard and the kid, the dog and the hare, all should
dwell side by side in unbroken peace and friendship. The hare said,
"Oh! how I have longed for this day when the weak take their place
without fear by the side of the strong!"</p>
