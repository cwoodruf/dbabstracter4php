<div class="story">
<p>When people go on a voyage they often take with them <span class="picturedef lap">lap</span>
-<span class="picturedef dog">dog</span>s or
monkeys as pets to wile away the time. Thus it fell out that a <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
returning to Athens from the East had a <span class="picturedef pet">pet</span>
 <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span> on board with
him. As they neared the coast of Attica a great <span class="picturedef storm">storm</span>
 <span class="picturedef burst">burst</span> upon
them, and the <span class="picturedef ship">ship</span>
 capsized. All on board were thrown into the
<span class="picturedef water">water</span>
, and tried to save themselves by swimming, the <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 among the rest. A <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
 <span class="picturedef saw">saw</span>
 him, and, supposing him to be a <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
, took him on his <span class="picturedef back">back</span>
 and began swimming towards the shore. When they got
near the Piraeus, which is the port of Athens, the <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
 asked the <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 if he was an Athenian. The <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
</div>
<div class="storybottom">
 replied that he was, and added that he came of a very distinguished 
<span class="picturedef family">family</span>. 
"Then, of course, you know the Piraeus," 
continued the <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>. 
The <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
thought he was referring to some high official or other, and
replied, "Oh, yes, he's a very <span class="picturedef old">old</span>
 friend of mine." At that, detecting his hypocrisy, the 
<span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
 was so <span class="picturedef disgust">disgusted</span>
 that he dived below the surface, and the unfortunate 
<span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span> was quickly drowned.</p>
