<h2>VENUS AND THE CAT</h2>
<br>
<p>A Cat fell in love with a handsome young man, and begged the
goddess Venus to change her into a woman. Venus was very gracious
about it, and changed her at once into a beautiful maiden, whom the
young man fell in love with at first sight and shortly afterwards
married. One day Venus thought she would like to see whether the
Cat had changed her habits as well as her form; so she let a mouse
run loose in the room where they were. Forgetting everything, the
young woman had no sooner seen the mouse than up she jumped and was
after it like a shot: at which the goddess was so disgusted that
she changed her back again into a Cat.</p>
