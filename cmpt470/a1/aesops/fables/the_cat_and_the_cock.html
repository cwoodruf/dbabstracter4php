<h2>THE CAT AND THE COCK</h2>
<br>
<p>A Cat pounced on a Cock, and cast about for some good excuse for
making a meal off him, for Cats don't as a rule eat Cocks, and she
knew she ought not to. At last she said, "You make a great nuisance
of yourself at night by crowing and keeping people awake: so I am
going to make an end of you." But the Cock defended himself by
saying that he crowed in order that men might wake up and set about
the day's work in good time, and that they really couldn't very
well do without him. "That may be," said the Cat, "but whether they
can or not, I'm not going without my dinner"; and she killed and
ate him.</p>
<p class="adage">The want of a good excuse never kept a villain
from crime.</p>
