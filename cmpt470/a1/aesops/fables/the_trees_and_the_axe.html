<h2>THE TREES AND THE AXE</h2>
<br>
<p>A Woodman went into the forest and begged of the Trees the
favour of a handle for his Axe. The principal Trees at once agreed
to so modest a request, and unhesitatingly gave him a young ash
sapling, out of which he fashioned the handle he desired. No sooner
had he done so than he set to work to fell the noblest Trees in the
wood. When they saw the use to which he was putting their gift,
they cried, "Alas! alas! We are undone, but we are ourselves to
blame. The little we gave has cost us all: had we not sacrificed
the rights of the ash, we might ourselves have stood for ages."</p>
