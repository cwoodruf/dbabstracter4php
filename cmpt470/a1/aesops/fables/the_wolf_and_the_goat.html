<h2>THE WOLF AND THE GOAT</h2>
<br>
<p>A Wolf caught sight of a Goat browsing above him on the scanty
herbage that grew on the top of a steep rock; and being unable to
get at her, tried to induce her to come lower down. "You are
risking your life up there, madam, indeed you are," he called out:
"pray take my advice and come down here, where you will find plenty
of better food." The Goat turned a knowing eye upon him. "It's
little you care whether I get good grass or bad," said she: "what
you want is to eat me."</p>
