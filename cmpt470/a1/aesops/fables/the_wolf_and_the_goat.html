<h2>THE WOLF AND THE GOAT</h2>
<br>
<p>A <span class="picturedef wolf">wolf</span>
 caught sight of a <span class="picturedef goat">goat</span>
 browsing above him on the scanty
herbage that grew on the <span class="picturedef top">top</span>
 of a <span class="picturedef steep">steep</span>
 rock; and being unable to
get at her, tried to induce her to come lower <span class="picturedef down">down</span>
. "You are
risking your life <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 there, madam, indeed you are," he called out:
"pray take my advice and come <span class="picturedef down">down</span>
 here, where you will find plenty
of better food." The <span class="picturedef goat">goat</span>
 turned a knowing <span class="picturedef eye">eye</span>
 upon him. "It's
little you care whether I get good <span class="picturedef grass">grass</span>
 or bad," said she: "what
you want is to eat me."</p>
