<h2>THE FLEA AND THE MAN</h2>
<br>
<p>A <span class="picturedef flea">flea</span>
 bit a <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
, and bit him again, and again, till he could
<span class="picturedef stand">stand</span>
 it no longer, but made a thorough search for it, and at last
succeeded in <span class="picturedef catch">catching</span>
 it. Holding it <span class="picturedef between">between</span>
 his finger and <span class="picturedef thumb">thumb</span>
,
he said&mdash;or rather <span class="picturedef shout">shouted</span>
, so <span class="picturedef angry">angry</span>
 was he&mdash;"Who are
you, pray, you wretched little creature, that you make so free with
my person?" The <span class="picturedef flea">flea</span>
, terrified, whimpered in a weak little voice,
"Oh, sir! pray let me go; don't kill me! I am such a little thing
that I can't do you much harm." But the <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
 laughed and said, "I am
going to kill you now, at once: whatever is bad has got to be
destroyed, no matter how slight the harm it does."</p>
<p class="adage">Do not waste your pity on a scamp.</p>
