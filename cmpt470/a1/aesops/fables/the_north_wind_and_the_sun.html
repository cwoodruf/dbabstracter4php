<h2>THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN</h2>
<br>
<p>A dispute arose between the North Wind and the Sun, each
claiming that he was stronger than the other. At last they agreed
to try their powers upon a traveller, to see which could soonest
strip him of his cloak. The North Wind had the first try; and,
gathering up all his force for the attack, he came whirling
furiously down upon the man, and caught up his cloak as though he
would wrest it from him by one single effort: but the harder he
blew, the more closely the man wrapped it round himself. Then came
the turn of the Sun. At first he beamed gently upon the traveller,
who soon unclasped his cloak and walked on with it hanging loosely
about his shoulders: then he shone forth in his full strength, and
the man, before he had gone many steps, was glad to throw his cloak
right off and complete his journey more lightly clad.</p>
