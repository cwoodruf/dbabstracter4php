<p>A <span class="picturedef cat">cat</span>
 heard that the Birds in an <span class="picturedef aviary">aviary</span>

himself <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 as a <span class="picturedef doctor">doctor</span>
, and, taking with him a set of the
instruments proper to his profession, presented himself at the
<span class="picturedef door">door</span>

<span class="picturedef well">well</span>
," they replied, without letting him in, "when we've seen the

<h2>THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN</h2>
<br>
<p>A dispute arose <span class="picturedef between">between</span>
 the North <span class="picturedef wind">wind</span>
 and the <span class="picturedef sun">sun</span>
, each
claiming that he was stronger than the other. At last they agreed
to try their powers upon a traveller, to see which could soonest
strip him of his <span class="picturedef cloak">cloak</span>
. The North <span class="picturedef wind">wind</span>
 had the first try; and,
gathering <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 all his force for the attack, he came whirling
furiously <span class="picturedef down">down</span>
 upon the <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
, and caught <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 his <span class="picturedef cloak">cloak</span>
 as though he
would wrest it from him by one single effort: but the harder he
blew, the more closely the <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
 wrapped it round himself. Then came
the turn of the <span class="picturedef sun">sun</span>
. At first he beamed gently upon the traveller,
who soon unclasped his <span class="picturedef cloak">cloak</span>
 and <span class="picturedef walk">walked</span>
 on with it <span class="picturedef hang">hanging</span>
 <span class="picturedef loose">loosely</span>

about his shoulders: then he shone forth in his <span class="picturedef full">full</span>

the <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
, before he had gone many steps, was glad to <span class="picturedef throw">throw</span>
 his <span class="picturedef cloak">cloak</span>

<span class="picturedef right">right</span>

set before him a pitcher with a long and <span class="picturedef narrow">narrow</span>

<p>Time was when the Frogs were discontented because they had no

of his appearance that he thought life was not worth living unless
he could persuade the other Foxes to part with their tails also,
and thus divert attention from his own loss. So he called a meeting
of all the Foxes, and advised them to cut off their tails: "They're
ugly things anyhow," he said, "and besides they're heavy, and it's
tiresome to be always carrying them about with you." But one of the

<h2>THE TREES AND THE AXE</h2>
<br>
<p>A Woodman went into the <span class="picturedef forest">forest</span>
 and begged of the Trees the
favour of a <span class="picturedef handle">handle</span>
 for his <span class="picturedef axe">axe</span>
. The <span class="picturedef principal">principal</span>
 Trees at once agreed
to so modest a request, and unhesitatingly gave him a <span class="picturedef young">young</span>
 <span class="picturedef ash">ash</span>

sapling, out of which he fashioned the <span class="picturedef handle">handle</span>
 he desired. No sooner
had he done so than he set to work to fell the noblest Trees in the
<span class="picturedef wood">wood</span>
. When they <span class="picturedef saw">saw</span>
 the use to which he was putting their <span class="picturedef gift">gift</span>
,
they cried, "Alas! alas! We are undone, but we are ourselves to
blame. The little we gave has cost us all: had we not sacrificed
the rights of the <span class="picturedef ash">ash</span>
, we might ourselves have stood for ages."</p>

<h2>THE MULE</h2>
<br>
<p>One <span class="picturedef morning">morning</span>
 a Mule, who had too much to eat and too little to
do, began to think himself a very fine fellow indeed, and frisked
about saying, "My <span class="picturedef father">father</span>
 was undoubtedly a high-spirited <span class="picturedef horse">horse</span>
 and
I take after him entirely." But very soon afterwards he was put
into the harness and compelled to go a very long way with a heavy
load <span class="picturedef behind">behind</span>
 him. At the end of the day, exhausted by his unusual
exertions, he said dejectedly to himself, "I must have been
mistaken about my <span class="picturedef father">father</span>
; he can only have been an ass after
all."</p>

<h2>THE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN</h2>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/213.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>When people go on a voyage they often take with them <span class="picturedef lap">lap</span>
-dogs or
monkeys as pets to wile away the time. Thus it fell out that a <span class="picturedef man">man</span>

returning to Athens from the East had a <span class="picturedef pet">pet</span>
 <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 on board with
him. As they neared the coast of Attica a great <span class="picturedef storm">storm</span>
 <span class="picturedef burst">burst</span>
 upon
them, and the <span class="picturedef ship">ship</span>
 capsized. All on board were thrown into the
<span class="picturedef water">water</span>
, and tried to save themselves by swimming, the <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 among
the rest. A <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
 <span class="picturedef saw">saw</span>
 him, and, supposing him to be a <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
, took
him on his <span class="picturedef back">back</span>
 and began swimming towards the shore. When they got
near the Piraeus, which is the port of Athens, the <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
 asked
the <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 if he was an Athenian. The <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 replied that he was,
and added that he came of a very distinguished <span class="picturedef family">family</span>
. "Then, of
course, you know the Piraeus," continued the <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
. The <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>

thought he was referring to some high official or other, and
replied, "Oh, yes, he's a very <span class="picturedef old">old</span>
 friend of <span class="picturedef mine">mine</span>
." At that,
detecting his hypocrisy, the <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
 was so <span class="picturedef disgust">disgusted</span>
 that he dived
below the surface, and the unfortunate <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 was quickly
drowned.</p>

<h2>THE WOLF AND HIS SHADOW</h2>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/220.jpg" alt="THE WOLF AND HIS SHADOW"></div>
<p>A <span class="picturedef wolf">wolf</span>
, who was roaming about on the <span class="picturedef plain">plain</span>
 when the <span class="picturedef sun">sun</span>
 was
getting low in the <span class="picturedef sky">sky</span>
, was much impressed by the size of his
<span class="picturedef shadow">shadow</span>
, and said to himself, "I had no idea I was so <span class="picturedef big">big</span>
. Fancy my
being afraid of a <span class="picturedef lion">lion</span>
! Why, I, not he, ought to be <span class="picturedef king">king</span>
 of the
beasts"; and, heedless of danger, he strutted about as if there
could be no doubt at all about it. Just then a <span class="picturedef lion">lion</span>
 sprang upon him
and began to devour him. "Alas," he cried, "had I not lost sight of
the facts, I shouldn't have been <span class="picturedef ruin">ruined</span>
 by my fancies."</p>

<h2>THE GNAT AND THE LION</h2>
<br>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/227.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>A Gnat once went <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 to a <span class="picturedef lion">lion</span>
 and said, "I am not in the least
afraid of you: I don't even allow that you are a match for me in
strength. What does your strength amount to after all? That you can
<span class="picturedef scratch">scratch</span>
 with your claws and <span class="picturedef bite">bite</span>
 with your <span class="picturedef teeth">teeth</span>
&mdash;just <span class="picturedef like">like</span>
 a
<span class="picturedef woman">woman</span>
 in a temper&mdash;and nothing more. But I'm stronger than
you: if you don't believe it, let us <span class="picturedef fight">fight</span>
 and see." So saying, the
Gnat sounded his horn, and darted in and bit the <span class="picturedef lion">lion</span>
 on the <span class="picturedef nose">nose</span>
.
When the <span class="picturedef lion">lion</span>
 <span class="picturedef felt">felt</span>
 the sting, in his haste to crush him he
<span class="picturedef scratch">scratched</span>
 his <span class="picturedef nose">nose</span>
 badly, and made it bleed, but failed altogether
to hurt the Gnat, which buzzed off in triumph, elated by its
victory. Presently, however, it got entangled in a <span class="picturedef spider">spider</span>
's <span class="picturedef web">web</span>
,
and was caught and eaten by the <span class="picturedef spider">spider</span>
, thus falling a prey to an
insignificant insect after having triumphed <span class="picturedef over">over</span>
 the <span class="picturedef king">king</span>
 of the
Beasts.</p>
