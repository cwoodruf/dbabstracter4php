This demonstration project is a system for providing 
automated messaging and callback services for vulnerable 
outdoor workers.

How it works:

Workers can call in and leave messages. Messages are sorted by
phone number based on caller id. Phone numbers are associated 
with individual workers via the web interface.

Optionally the system can be set to make a call back to the
worker after they leave a message. How long the system waits
is a parameter that can be set via the website for that 
individual worker.

The system tracks when people call in and will alert admins 
to people who are live on the system and have not called in in
a predetermined period of time.

Requirements:

This system has been tested with asterisk 1.4 and should work
with asterisk 1.6. The RecordKeys application is a custom app
that exists in this build of asterisk:

https://lifelinevm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/telephony

Its probably reasonable to not use RecordKeys as mostly people
would leave messages. 

Todo list:

Prompts need to be recorded for the telephony interface.
Improved web interface. 
Make system work with more than one group sharing the database.
Integrate location services with contact calls.
Probably much more.
