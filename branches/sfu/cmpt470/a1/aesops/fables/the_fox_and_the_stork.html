<h2>THE FOX AND THE STORK</h2>
<br>
<p>A Fox invited a Stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided
was a large flat dish of soup. The Fox lapped it up with great
relish, but the Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake
of the savoury broth. Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much
amusement. But not long after the Stork invited him in turn, and
set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which
she could get her bill with ease. Thus, while she enjoyed her
dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible
for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel.</p>
