<h2>THE FLEA AND THE MAN</h2>
<br>
<p>A Flea bit a Man, and bit him again, and again, till he could
stand it no longer, but made a thorough search for it, and at last
succeeded in catching it. Holding it between his finger and thumb,
he said&mdash;or rather shouted, so angry was he&mdash;"Who are
you, pray, you wretched little creature, that you make so free with
my person?" The Flea, terrified, whimpered in a weak little voice,
"Oh, sir! pray let me go; don't kill me! I am such a little thing
that I can't do you much harm." But the Man laughed and said, "I am
going to kill you now, at once: whatever is bad has got to be
destroyed, no matter how slight the harm it does."</p>
