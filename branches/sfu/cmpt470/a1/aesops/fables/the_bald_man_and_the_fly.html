 settled on the <span class="picturedef head">head</span>
 of a <span class="picturedef bald">bald</span>
 <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
 and bit him. In his
eagerness to kill it, he hit himself a smart slap. But the <span class="picturedef fly">fly</span>

escaped, and said to him in derision, "You tried to kill me for
just one little <span class="picturedef bite">bite</span>

, I'd have borne a good deal more than that for the
satisfaction of dashing the life out of you!"</p>
