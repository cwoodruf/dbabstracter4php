<p>A Fly settled on the head of a Bald Man and bit him. In his
eagerness to kill it, he hit himself a smart slap. But the Fly
escaped, and said to him in derision, "You tried to kill me for
just one little bite; what will you do to yourself now, for the
heavy smack you have just given yourself?" "Oh, for that blow I
bear no grudge," he replied, "for I never intended myself any harm;
but as for you, you contemptible insect, who live by sucking human
blood, I'd have borne a good deal more than that for the
satisfaction of dashing the life out of you!"</p>
