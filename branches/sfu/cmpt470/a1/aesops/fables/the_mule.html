<h2>THE MULE</h2>
<br>
<p>One morning a Mule, who had too much to eat and too little to
do, began to think himself a very fine fellow indeed, and frisked
about saying, "My father was undoubtedly a high-spirited horse and
I take after him entirely." But very soon afterwards he was put
into the harness and compelled to go a very long way with a heavy
load behind him. At the end of the day, exhausted by his unusual
exertions, he said dejectedly to himself, "I must have been
mistaken about my father; he can only have been an ass after
all."</p>
