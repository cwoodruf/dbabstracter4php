<h2>THE MAN AND THE SATYR</h2>
<br>
<p>A Man and a Satyr became friends, and determined to live
together. All went well for a while, until one day in winter-time
the Satyr saw the Man blowing on his hands. "Why do you do that?"
he asked. "To warm my hands," said the Man. That same day, when
they sat down to supper together, they each had a steaming hot bowl
of porridge, and the Man raised his bowl to his mouth and blew on
it. "Why do you do that?" asked the Satyr. "To cool my porridge,"
said the Man. The Satyr got up from the table. "Good-bye," said he,
"I'm going: I can't be friends with a man who blows hot and cold
with the same breath."</p>
