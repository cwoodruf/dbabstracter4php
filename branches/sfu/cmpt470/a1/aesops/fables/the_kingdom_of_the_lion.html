 the beasts of the <span class="picturedef earth">earth</span>
 he was never
cruel or tyrannical, but as gentle and just as a <span class="picturedef king">king</span>
 ought to be.
During his reign he called a general assembly of the beasts, and
drew <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 a code of laws <span class="picturedef under">under</span>
 which all were to live in perfect
equality and harmony: the <span class="picturedef wolf">wolf</span>
 and the <span class="picturedef lamb">lamb</span>
, the <span class="picturedef tiger">tiger</span>
 and the
stag, the <span class="picturedef leopard">leopard</span>
 and the <span class="picturedef kid">kid</span>
, the <span class="picturedef dog">dog</span>
 and the <span class="picturedef hare">hare</span>
, all should
dwell side by side in unbroken peace and friendship. The <span class="picturedef hare">hare</span>
 said,
"Oh! how I have longed for this day when the weak take their place
without fear by the side of the strong!"</p>
