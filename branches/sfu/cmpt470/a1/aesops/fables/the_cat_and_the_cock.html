<h2>THE CAT AND THE COCK</h2>
<br>
<p>A <span class="picturedef cat">cat</span>
 pounced on a Cock, and <span class="picturedef cast">cast</span>
 about for some good excuse for
making a meal off him, for Cats don't as a rule eat Cocks, and she
knew she ought not to. At last she said, "You make a great nuisance
of yourself at <span class="picturedef night">night</span>
 by <span class="picturedef crow">crowing</span>
 and keeping people awake: so I am
going to make an end of you." But the Cock defended himself by
saying that he <span class="picturedef crow">crowed</span>
 in order that men might wake <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 and set about
the day's work in good time, and that they really couldn't very
<span class="picturedef well">well</span>
 do without him. "That may be," said the <span class="picturedef cat">cat</span>
, "but whether they
can or not, I'm not going without my <span class="picturedef dinner">dinner</span>
"; and she killed and
ate him.</p>
<p class="adage">The want of a good excuse never kept a villain
from crime.</p>
