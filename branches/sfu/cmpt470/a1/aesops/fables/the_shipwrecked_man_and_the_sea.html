<h2>THE SHIPWRECKED MAN AND THE SEA</h2>
<br>
<p>A Shipwrecked Man cast up on the beach fell asleep after his
struggle with the waves. When he woke up, he bitterly reproached
the Sea for its treachery in enticing men with its smooth and
smiling surface, and then, when they were well embarked, turning in
fury upon them and sending both ship and sailors to destruction.
The Sea arose in the form of a woman, and replied, "Lay not the
blame on me, O sailor, but on the Winds. By nature I am as calm and
safe as the land itself: but the Winds fall upon me with their
gusts and gales, and lash me into a fury that is not natural to
me."</p>
