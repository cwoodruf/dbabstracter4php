<p>Some Thieves broke into a house, and found nothing worth taking
except a Cock, which they seized and carried off with them. When
they were preparing their supper, one of them caught up the Cock,
and was about to wring his neck, when he cried out for mercy and
said, "Pray do not kill me: you will find me a most useful bird,
for I rouse honest men to their work in the morning by my crowing."
But the Thief replied with some heat, "Yes, I know you do, making
it still harder for us to get a livelihood. Into the pot you
go!"</p>
