<p>A Gnat once went <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 to a <span class="picturedef lion">lion</span>
 and said, "I am not in the least
afraid of you: I don't even allow that you are a match for me in
strength. What does your strength amount to after all? That you can
<span class="picturedef scratch">scratch</span>
 with your claws and <span class="picturedef bite">bite</span>
 with your <span class="picturedef teeth">teeth</span>
&mdash;just <span class="picturedef like">like</span>
 a
<span class="picturedef woman">woman</span>
 in a temper&mdash;and nothing more. But I'm stronger than
you: if you don't believe it, let us <span class="picturedef fight">fight</span>
 and see." So saying, the
Gnat sounded his horn, and darted in and bit the <span class="picturedef lion">lion</span>
 on the <span class="picturedef nose">nose</span>
.
When the <span class="picturedef lion">lion</span>
 <span class="picturedef felt">felt</span>
 the sting, in his haste to crush him he
<span class="picturedef scratch">scratched</span>
 his <span class="picturedef nose">nose</span>
 badly, and made it bleed, but failed altogether
to hurt the Gnat, which buzzed off in triumph, elated by its
victory. Presently, however, it got entangled in a <span class="picturedef spider">spider</span>
's <span class="picturedef web">web</span>
,
and was caught and eaten by the <span class="picturedef spider">spider</span>
, thus falling a prey to an
insignificant insect after having triumphed <span class="picturedef over">over</span>
 the <span class="picturedef king">king</span>
 of the
Beasts.</p>
