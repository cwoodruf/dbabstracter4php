<p>A Gnat once went up to a Lion and said, "I am not in the least
afraid of you: I don't even allow that you are a match for me in
strength. What does your strength amount to after all? That you can
scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth&mdash;just like a
woman in a temper&mdash;and nothing more. But I'm stronger than
you: if you don't believe it, let us fight and see." So saying, the
Gnat sounded his horn, and darted in and bit the Lion on the nose.
When the Lion felt the sting, in his haste to crush him he
scratched his nose badly, and made it bleed, but failed altogether
to hurt the Gnat, which buzzed off in triumph, elated by its
victory. Presently, however, it got entangled in a spider's web,
and was caught and eaten by the spider, thus falling a prey to an
insignificant insect after having triumphed over the King of the
Beasts.</p>
