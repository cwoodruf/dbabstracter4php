<h2>THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN</h2>
<br>
<p>A dispute arose <span class="picturedef between">between</span>
 the North <span class="picturedef wind">wind</span>
 and the <span class="picturedef sun">sun</span>
, each
claiming that he was stronger than the other. At last they agreed
to try their powers upon a traveller, to see which could soonest
strip him of his <span class="picturedef cloak">cloak</span>
. The North <span class="picturedef wind">wind</span>
 had the first try; and,
gathering <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 all his force for the attack, he came whirling
furiously <span class="picturedef down">down</span>
 upon the <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
, and caught <span class="picturedef up">up</span>
 his <span class="picturedef cloak">cloak</span>
 as though he
would wrest it from him by one single effort: but the harder he
blew, the more closely the <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
 wrapped it round himself. Then came
the turn of the <span class="picturedef sun">sun</span>
. At first he beamed gently upon the traveller,
who soon unclasped his <span class="picturedef cloak">cloak</span>
 and <span class="picturedef walk">walked</span>
 on with it <span class="picturedef hang">hanging</span>
 <span class="picturedef loose">loosely</span>

about his shoulders: then he shone forth in his <span class="picturedef full">full</span>
 strength, and
the <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
, before he had gone many steps, was glad to <span class="picturedef throw">throw</span>
 his <span class="picturedef cloak">cloak</span>

<span class="picturedef right">right</span>
 off and complete his journey more lightly clad.</p>
