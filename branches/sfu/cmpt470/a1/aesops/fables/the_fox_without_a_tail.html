<br>
<p>A fox once fell into a trap, and after a struggle managed to get
free, but with the loss of his brush. He was then so much ashamed
of his appearance that he thought life was not worth living unless
he could persuade the other Foxes to part with their tails also,
and thus divert attention from his own loss. So he called a meeting
of all the Foxes, and advised them to cut off their tails: "They're
ugly things anyhow," he said, "and besides they're heavy, and it's
tiresome to be always carrying them about with you." But one of the
other Foxes said, "My friend, if you hadn't lost your own tail, you
wouldn't be so keen on getting us to cut off ours."</p>
