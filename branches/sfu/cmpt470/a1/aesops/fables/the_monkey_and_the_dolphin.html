<h2>THE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN</h2>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/213.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>When people go on a voyage they often take with them <span class="picturedef lap">lap</span>
-dogs or
monkeys as pets to wile away the time. Thus it fell out that a <span class="picturedef man">man</span>

returning to Athens from the East had a <span class="picturedef pet">pet</span>
 <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 on board with
him. As they neared the coast of Attica a great <span class="picturedef storm">storm</span>
 <span class="picturedef burst">burst</span>
 upon
them, and the <span class="picturedef ship">ship</span>
 capsized. All on board were thrown into the
<span class="picturedef water">water</span>
, and tried to save themselves by swimming, the <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 among
the rest. A <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
 <span class="picturedef saw">saw</span>
 him, and, supposing him to be a <span class="picturedef man">man</span>
, took
him on his <span class="picturedef back">back</span>
 and began swimming towards the shore. When they got
near the Piraeus, which is the port of Athens, the <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
 asked
the <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 if he was an Athenian. The <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 replied that he was,
and added that he came of a very distinguished <span class="picturedef family">family</span>
. "Then, of
course, you know the Piraeus," continued the <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
. The <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>

thought he was referring to some high official or other, and
replied, "Oh, yes, he's a very <span class="picturedef old">old</span>
 friend of <span class="picturedef mine">mine</span>
." At that,
detecting his hypocrisy, the <span class="picturedef dolphin">dolphin</span>
 was so <span class="picturedef disgust">disgusted</span>
 that he dived
below the surface, and the unfortunate <span class="picturedef monkey">monkey</span>
 was quickly
drowned.</p>
