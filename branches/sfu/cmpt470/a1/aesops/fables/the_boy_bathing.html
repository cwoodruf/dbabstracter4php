<h2>THE BOY BATHING</h2>
<br>
<p>A Boy was bathing in a river and got out of his depth, and was
in great danger of being drowned. A man who was passing along a
road heard his cries for help, and went to the riverside and began
to scold him for being so careless as to get into deep water, but
made no attempt to help him. "Oh, sir," cried the Boy, "please help
me first and scold me afterwards."</p>
